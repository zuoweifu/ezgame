## Inspiration
The idea of this game is inspired by Piano Tiles. Piano Tiles is a game where the player's objective is to tap on the black tiles as they appear from the top of the screen while avoiding the white.

## What it does
Similar to Piano Tiles, the main idea of this game is to tab the green block while avoiding yellow blocks. When the app is opened, the first page is a start page with a blue button says "Tap to play". When the blue button is pressed, it dumps to the main game page. As soon as the main game page is opened, a 10 seconds timers is triggered. You have to tab as much green blocks as possible while avoid touching any yellow blocks. Every time a green block is tabbed, you'll get one score. When the time is up or a yellow block is tabbed, it dumps to game over page where you can see your score.

## How I built it
I used react-native to develop this game. The editor i used is sublime. I also used Xcode but only used it for simulator.

## What's next for ezgame
In the future i'll add two important features to ezgame.

The first thing is to add a user system by using a database. This way i can store the scores of users to their accounts and make a ranking of highest scores of all users.

The second feature i'll add is different modes. For now there is only one mode, tab 9 blocks in 10 seconds. I'll add more modes so users can pick the number of blocks and duration of game.
